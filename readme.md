simple snake project thing that uses a crappy bot with my implmentation of the A* algorythum,
so feel free to steal my crap code if you wanna, ill get the last laugh because it sucks a lot,

uses sdl2, so you have to get sdl2.lib and sdl2.dll if your on windows to compile it, same goes for the raycaster i made a while back,
just forgot to mention it in the readme file and dont feel like changing it
